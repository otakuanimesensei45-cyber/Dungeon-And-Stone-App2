# Dungeon & Stone — PWA (GitHub Pages Ready)

This folder is ready to deploy to **GitHub Pages**. Everything uses **relative paths**, so it works from a project site like:
`https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Deploy (quick)
1. Create a new GitHub repository (any name).
2. Upload **all files in this folder** to the repo root (keep `index.html`, `sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`, and the `icons/` folder at the top level).
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages** → "Deploy from a branch" → Branch: **main**, Folder: **/** → **Save**.
4. Wait up to 1 minute, then visit: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Install on phone
Open the URL in Chrome → menu **Install app** (or **Add to Home screen**).

## Update later
- Re-upload changed files to the repo.
- If you don’t see changes immediately, do a hard refresh (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R) to update the service worker cache.
